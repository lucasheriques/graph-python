# Graph implementation
This is a graph implementation, using adjacency matrix on Python. 

## Graph
Following methods are included:

- Number of vertices and edges
- Number of pending and isolated vertices
- Number of components
- Degree of vertices and its neighbors
- Checks if the graph is simple, regular, null, complete, eulerian and unicursal
- Complementary graph
- Checks if the graph is biparted
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Checks if the graph is a tree
- Minimum spanning tree, obtained by Prim's Algorithm
- Minimum spanning tree, obtained by Kruskal's Algorithm
- Number of cut-vertices/articulation points

## Digraph
- Checks if graph is regular, balanced, strongly connected and eulerian
 - Dijkstra: shortest path to all vertices starting from 0
 
 ## Inputs
 The graph will be read from a .txt file. There are samples on the folder input.
 
 They were taken from: [VisuAlgo - Graph Data Structures](https://visualgo.net/en/graphds)
